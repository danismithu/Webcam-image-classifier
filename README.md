# Webcam-image-classifier
This image classifier uses your Webcam and TensorFlow.js to learn three different models and then predict them based on the image captured by the Webcam. 

## Usage
The web app contains three buttons. Each button teach a different model to the classifier. For example, you put an apple in front of the webcam and press the button A it will learn how an apple looks and it will call it "A". Remember, the more you press the button the better it will learn to recognize it. Then you put a banana and press the button B it will then recognize it as "B". For last, getting yourself in front of the webcam and pressing button C will recognize you as "C". Then depending on the object you show to the webcam, the classifier will predict which of the three elements is present.
